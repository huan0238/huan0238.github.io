All the website images are from https://www.pexels.com/

My profile picture was taken by myself.

Site of the ICONS are from https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/.

In this final project, I used bootstrap to complete my project. I think bootstrap is a very simple method. It is very simple and can produce beautiful and powerful websites. However, Bootstrap has its own problems. In terms of some special colors and designs, I need to use my own CSS to implement it. For example, I used CSS to change the color of the website. In addition, the Grid system of Bootstrap is based on Flex-Box, so some layouts are not as powerful as CSS-GIRD. Bootstrapr in general makes our job easier.
